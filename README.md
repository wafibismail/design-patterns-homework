### About colons (:)
Both in JavaScript and TypeScript, colons are used in object notations to represent properties e.g.
```javascript
object = {
  property1: value1,
  property2: value2
}
```
...but they're also used to specify variable types in TypeScript e.g.
```typescript
location: string = "Library"
```
